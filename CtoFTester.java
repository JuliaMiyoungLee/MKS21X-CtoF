/*I would need the parameters that give the starting degrees value and then one that indicates whether that value is in F or C.
The degrees would be a double and whether the value is F or C I would make a char.
I would prompt the person to type either 'F' or 'C' depending on whether its Farenheit or celcius
I would have the functions return a double and then round the double later when I print it*/
